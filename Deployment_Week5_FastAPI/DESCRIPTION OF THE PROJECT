In this project, we continued the churn prediction model from Chapter 3 of ML Zoomcamp 2025. The focus of this session was deploying the model so it can be used without running the training code every time.

Here’s what was done in this homework:

Churn Prediction Model

The model was trained and evaluated in a Google Colab notebook.

Model Deployment

A FastAPI application was created to serve the model through an API.

The trained model (model.pkl) is loaded in the API, and predictions can be made via endpoints.

Using the Model on Other Machines

The project was containerized using Docker and pushed to Docker Hub.

This allows anyone to pull the Docker image and run the container without needing Colab or the original code.

API Endpoints

Endpoints such as /predict were implemented to receive input data and return predictions.

✅ Summary: The churn model is fully deployable and can be used on any machine through the API or Docker container, making it reproducible and ready for practical use.
